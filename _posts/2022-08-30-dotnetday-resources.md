You probably arrived on this page after watching [my talk about Dependency Confusion](https://dotnetday.ch/speakers/andrei-epure.html) at DotNetDay Switzerland on the 30th of August 2022.

As a reminder, these are the three easy steps to do in order to secure you NuGet supply chain against dependency confusion attacks (links to Microsoft docs):

1. Use [Package Source Mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-source-mapping)
2. Use `<trusted signers>`: [Manage package trust boundaries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/installing-signed-packages)
3. Reserve prefixes for both your public and private packages on nuget.org: [Package ID prefix reservation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/id-prefix-reservation)

The source code for my demos [is on GitHub](https://github.com/andreiepure/DependencyConfusionDemo), feel free to use it when explaining the problem to your colleagues.

You can read about the NuGet historical design decision of having a non-deterministic package resolution behavior for hybrid configurations (fetching packages from all configured sources in parallel): [NuGet/Home#5611](
