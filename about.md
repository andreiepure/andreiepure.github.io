First of all, I am a human person, which is quite a lot in itself.

In addition, I am also a:
- Romanian, proud alumni of the Politehnica University of Bucharest and "Vasile Alecsandri" College in Galati
- husband, son, brother, godson, godfather and friend
- Orthodox Christian, volunteer in my local parish and in Nepsis CH
- Software Engineer, proud member of the Languages Team at Sonarsource, building the ultimate automatic code review tools. I'm also a Microsoft alumni, I was part of the Office Membership Experience (OMEX) team in Dublin, helping users try, buy and manage Office 365 subscriptions.

On a personal level, I am interested in understanding the visible (science, history) and the invisible (spirit).

I speak Romanian (a Romance language with lots of influences from other languages), English and French.

I am writing code mainly in C# and Java.
