I am a software developer in the Languages Team at [SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com/). We create [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), [SonarCloud](http://sonarcloud.io/) and [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/), tools which millions of developers and tens of thousands of organizations use to deliver better, more secure software. Previously, I wrote software at Microsoft Ireland, empowering customers to buy and manage their Office 365 subscriptions.
