First of all, I am a human person, which is quite a lot in itself.

In addition to being a Software Engineer, I am also a:
- [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania), proud alumni of the [Politehnica University of Bucharest](https://upb.ro/en/) and ["Vasile Alecsandri" College in Galati](https://cnva.eu/)
- husband, son, brother, godson, godfather and friend
- [Orthodox Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church), volunteer in [my local parish](http://biserica.ch/) and in [Nepsis CH](http://ch.nepsis.org/)
- proud member of the Languages Team at [sonarsource](https://sonarsource.com/), building the ultimate automatic code review tools
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) alumni. I worked for 3 years in the Office Membership Experience (OMEX) team in Dublin, where I built software to enable users to try, buy and manage Office 365 subscriptions.

On a personal level, I am interested in understanding the visible (science, history) and the invisible (spirit).

I speak [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language) (a Romance language with lots of influences from other languages), English and French.
