I am a seasoned software engineer and engineering manager specializing in developer tooling.

I currently work as the Engineering Manager of the .NET Squad in the Analysis Team at [Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com/) - we write the open-source Roslyn static code analyzers that power SonarQube, SonarCloud and SonarLint (and you can get them for free [as NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SonarAnalyzer.CSharp)).

Previously, I wrote software at Microsoft Ireland, empowering customers to buy and manage their Office 365 subscriptions. I also worked for Almetis and Bitdefender.

I sometimes speak at developer conferences ([Sessionize profile](https://sessionize.com/andrei-epure/)).
