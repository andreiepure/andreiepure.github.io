title:  "My first year as a public speaker"
---

It's the end of December, a great time for doing a retrospective of my first year as a public speaker.

I wanted to speak at a conference for a long time. I had already done "Brown Bag Lunch" (BBL) presentations inside Sonar, demystifying technical topics to a mixed technical and non-technical audience (for example, Object Oriented Thinking). My talks have been appreciated and this feedback encouraged me to think about widening the audience.

# DotNetDay Switzerland 2022

[.NET Day Switzerland](https://dotnetday.ch/) was the first time I spoke on a stage. It was awesome. However, I had prepared very well for it.

## Choosing a topic

After I read Alex BÃ®rsan's [Dependency Confusion: How I Hacked Into Apple, Microsoft, and Dozens of Other Companies](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610) article, I did a one-week investigation sprint at Sonar to make sure we were safe. Afterwards, I did a small technical presentation to the Languages Team, explaining the attack. Alex, one of our Product Managers, suggested then to do a BBL for the company. In the following months I gathered some ideas on how I could present this to a non-technical audience, but did not invest the time in making the presentation.

## The opportunity

At the end of March 2022, I found out that the Call for Speakers of .NET Day Switzerland 2022 was still open and I could apply. Our VP of Products asked me whether the .NET Bubble wants to present something. I asked my team mates, no one really wanted to, so I wrote down three ideas. One was about "Dependency Confusion" (I already had a sketch for the talk), the second about "Improving the performance for Roslyn analyzers" (we had invested some time in this topic in the previous 18 months for our .NET analyzers) and another one about how "Symbolic Execution" works (a geeky topic, and we had in-house Control Flow Graph and Symbolic Execution Engine implementations).

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to prepare the titles and the abstracts, so I sent an email to the organizers for a deadline extension, and Manuel Meyer replied that I could apply until April the 10th.

I applied with the "dependency confusion" and "improving the performance" talks, and the first one got accepted on April the 12th. 

## Preparing

I knew from my previous BBL experience that preparing a good talk is not easy. And this time it wasn't a 15-minute talk as before, but a 50-minute one.

I didn't have a lot of time - it was already mid-April and I had to have it ready by the end of August, and I had nothing yet, except two sheets of paper with a sketch. I had to have a plan. So I set myself some intermediate checkpoints:
- do a BBL explaining how the attack works to a non-technical audience by the end of May
- present the talk at two user groups before going on the big stage - forcing myself to have almost-ready versions that I could get feedback from .NET developers. Initially, I wanted to do one by the end of June and one in August.

## The BBL

I planned the BBL inside the company on the 2nd of June. It was good because I prepared the slides to explain in a visual manner was a package manager does and how the dependency confusion attack works. At this point, I created the Mr. Evil Hacker persona, which was very appreciated by my colleagues. I was watched by roughly 200 persons, some of which gave feedback on the hallways and via Slack, giving kudos for how well I helped non-technical people understand the concepts. Also, some of my technical colleagues gave kudos for raising awareness and with one we've discussed on how defending against it might work in the Java world.

## .NET Iasi virtual talk

I wanted to give a virtual talk at the [DotNet Iasi meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetiasi/), and an in-person one at the [Geneva .NET User Group](https://genevadnug.ch/). Unfortunately, the Geneva organisers asked me the slides before, and I didn't have them (I was using the meetups to motivate myself to reach intermediate checkpoints), so I only got a slot on August the 10th for DotNet Iasi. In hindsight, this was a good thing, because I would not have had the time to prepare something for the end of June or beginning of July (my suggestion for the Geneva DNUG).

For DotNet Iasi, I had to prepare quite a lot, and it took a couple of weekends to do it: change or improve the existing slides to fit a .NET technical audience, add new slides to explain how to defend against the attack and create demos. Moreover, I also though of adding Typosquatting to the presentation (more demos, more slides).
