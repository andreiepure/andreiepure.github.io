title:  "My view on Servant Leadership"
---

I wouldn't call myself a leader. However, in the past 18 months, I got recognition from my peers (indirectly) for my soft skills. I avoid on purpose associating "leadership" with my own person/activity because I believe in team work more than in leaders.

In SonarSource we have had a flat hierarchy (see [Travailler sans hiérarchie ? Expérience chez SonarSource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvi6wfih58)) which has evolved to a diverse leadership model (autonomous teams with no leader; autonomous teams with one leader; autonomous teams with a collective leadership) when the company grew from ~80 to ~200 employees in 2 years. The autonomy of individuals is one of the main personality traits we look for when [hiring](https://www.sonarsource.com/company/jobs/), and is at the core of our way of working.

After some colleagues left, I remained the sole maintainer of the [sonar-dotnet](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet) project, and also took the role of overseeing the hiring process for C# developers in the Languages Team here at SonarSource (the team that writes language analyzers). From the beginning, I wanted to hire people that would become autonomous leaders. I wanted the .NET sub-team (which we call "bubble") to be a team of leaders, which I believe we are. I don't take decisions by myself, we take decisions together about the way we work and what we work on. We are autonomous developers, in an autonomous "bubble", in an autonomous team. And I like that.

I believe this wouldn't be possible without [Servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). When I first stumbled upon the idea of Servant leadership on the SonarSource internal wiki, I immediately felt compatible with it (probably because I am a Christian, and, and Jesus washed the feet of his disciples - see [John 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13&version=KJV)).

The role of a servant leader is to serve his/her fellow mates, ensuring they grow as people and professionals, and achieve their full potential. Wikipedia says:

> As stated by its founder, Robert K. Greenleaf, a Servant Leader should be focused on, "Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?"

I want my team mates to be leaders. To grow. To be better than me.

What is your view on servant leadership?
