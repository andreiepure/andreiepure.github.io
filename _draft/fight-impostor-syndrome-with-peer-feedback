I've recently started being a public speaker at software engineering conferences. 
I only do this as a hobby. Thankfully, my company allows me to use my company time for this hobby.
But I have other priorities than preparing for talks, like engineering management. I need to serve my team.

Even if I prepared very well a talk (see my memories of 2022), going back on stage with it after a long pause, also after I had to change my demoes because NuGet removed the packages I used them and I needed to adapt my story.

I am afraid of failure. I am afraid that I am an impostor, and that in my previous talks I got lucky.

So I went back to the feedback I've received via an anonymous feedback form after .NET Day Switzerland. Nine people took their time to go to my website and fill in a feedback form. That's already a sign.

I'm just going to post here the verbatim feedback I've received in the feedback form, so that I can access it easily when I am in doubt about myself and about what  I can achieve*.

Question: What did you enjoy most about my  presentation ?

Answers (verbatim, I didn't correct spelling mistakes):
- "The theatre! it was hugely entertaining, and livened up what could be quite dell immensely"
- "Very interesting content, well presented"
- "Very engaging style of talking. Also very informative, with the right amount of humour (I loved Mr. Evil Hacker)"
- "Step by step build up, Tipps at the end"
- "Learning about a useful feature I can apply in my projects"
- "Just really well-rounded. It was interesting, useful, understandable and entertaining."
- "Your presentation skills."
- "The straight forward approach to explain the problem. Very well done!"

Question:
Presentation skills
For example, consider giving me feedback on some of the following points:
- how well did I know my topic?
- how logical was the  flow of my presentation?
- was my pacing appropriate (did I talk too quickly or too slowly)?
- how confident was I?
- how effective were my slides?

Answers:
- "Everything was on point ðŸ‘Œ"
- "Great simple demos, mabe some unneeded repetitions due to nervousness ;-)"
- "At the end of the presentation, you thanked too much and were overly polite. You know your stuff, so don't be afraid to show it. Slides were well polished, the topic was new and of interest."
- "I'm pretty new to .net and hadn't really worked with the nuget config much, but could still easily follow. Big Kudos for that!"
- "I think it was perfect"
- "You presented it very well. It was the best talk of the conference. I liked it a lot!"

Question: Anything else to comment on

Answers:
- "It was super well prepared and thought through. Pace was perfect, loads of good content, nice mix of background, demos and entertainment. Presentation was hilarious! I really appreciated the details. Great work, I think you'll soon be keynoting!"
- "Thanks for the talk!"
- "Overall my favorite presentation of the .net day. While the keynote speakers are obviously extremely experienced and had a great presentation styles, your talk was more useful for me so it's the one I'll recommend to others."
- "Big fan of your talk! :) Your talk made worth it to show up at the conference."

Being a bit doubtful about ourselves is good to avoid the trap of narcissism, of overestimating who we are (especially if that means considering others below us...).
But doubting of our own qualities and our own achievements can be toxic and counter-productive.

Whenever I tend to fall in the trap of doubting myself, I need to go back to peer feedback. What the people around me tell about me (both positive and constructive feedback) has some value (even if not absolute value and it does not define me as a person).
