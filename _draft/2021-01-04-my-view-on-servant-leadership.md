title:  "My view on Servant Leadership"
---

In SonarSource we have had a flat hierarchy (see [Travailler sans hiérarchie ? Expérience chez SonarSource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvi6wfih58)) which has evolved to a diverse leadership model (autonomous teams with no leader; autonomous teams with one leader; autonomous teams with a collective leadership) when the company grew from ~80 to ~200 employees in 2 years. The autonomy of individuals is one of the main personality traits we look for when hiring ([check our open positions!](https://www.sonarsource.com/company/jobs/)), and is at the core of our way of working.

After some colleagues left, I remained the sole maintainer of the [sonar-dotnet](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet) project, and also took the role of overseeing the hiring process for C# developers in the Languages Team (LT) (the team that writes language analyzers). From the beginning, I wanted to hire people that would be(come) better than me and eventually grow as leaders. I wanted the .NET Bubble (that's how we call sub-teams in the LT) to be a team made of multiple leaders, where everyone has a voice and can drive projects and initiatives. I was blessed with wonderful colleagues who made this effort a success (although we're still hiring).

And this is actually how we operate at SonarSource: we collaborate instead of competing; we help instead of judging; we celebrate the achievements of our peers; we're evaluated based on how we collaborate with our peers rather than how we compare with them. I don't take decisions by myself, we take decisions together about the way we work and what we work on (that's what we call at SonarSource "Collective Intelligence"). In the LT, we are autonomous developers, in autonomous "bubbles", in an autonomous team. The other engineering teams have different organisations guided on the same principles - autonomy is at the core of our culture. We use common sense in what we do.

I believe this way of working wouldn't be possible without [Servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). When I first stumbled upon the idea of Servant leadership on the SonarSource internal wiki, I immediately felt compatible with it (probably because I am a Christian, and Jesus washed the feet of his disciples - see [John 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13&version=KJV)).

The role of a servant leader is to serve his/her fellow mates, ensuring they grow as people and professionals, and achieve their full potential. Wikipedia says:

> As stated by its founder, Robert K. Greenleaf, a Servant Leader should be focused on, "Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?"

I want my team mates to be leaders. To grow. To be better than me. I applied this at the level of the .NET Bubble and I have the joy of working in an autonomous team which works very well without a lead. We are currently 5 developers (and we want more colleagues) closely working with a Product Manager.

We are doing this in the LT also at higher level. The LT currently is made of 43 developers divided into 7 Bubbles and is led by a Council formed of 5 developers and the VP of Product Delivery (representing and liaising with the Management Team of Sonar). 

The purpose of the Council is not to tell people what to do, rather it's making sure the team is aligned with the strategy of the company and the team objectives, that bubbles and people can grow, that we manage to hire more people, and also ensure cross-team collaboration is happening with the other engineering teams. The Council as a whole works as a leader. The members of the Council also work as normal (albeit part-time) developers in their bubbles.

Doing project management is a responsibility of each bubble, as well as setting its own objectives, keeping in mind the company objectives.

The overall organisation of the team evolved over time and will likely evolve in the future.
