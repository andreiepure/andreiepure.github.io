title:  "Java vs C#: enums"
---

# Introduction

Java enums are closer to a class. C# enums are constants (int).
Show the bytecode and IL for each.

# Java beats C#

Ideas
- powerful APIs to encode behavior - can use constructor to capture data, avoiding the need of maps

# C# beats Java

ideas:
- size (just a constant vs a class)
- flags

# Alternatives for C#

- good news - proposal for discriminated unions in C# https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/discriminated-unions.md
- extension methods e.g. https://weyprecht.de/2019/10/16/enums-in-csharp-and-java/
- attributes e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/469287/c-sharp-vs-java-enum-for-those-new-to-c 
- nested types https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1376312/whats-the-equivalent-of-javas-enum-in-c
