Irina Scurt posted a [tweet about variable naming in C#](https://twitter.com/irina_scurtu/status/1645736205735059458) and I realized that I got multiple times feedback that I'm good at naming.

So, let's analyze a pull request that I reviewed and I suggested better names. I can explain what I'm doing, maybe I can formalize a bit my process.

- are you using the type (Set, List etc)? codeÂ smell
- are you using similar names before and after processing a data structure? (why not put the result in the name?)
