Summary: ccov for Java is more mature than for C#.

TL;DR:
C#
- MS VS ccov - supports branch coverage partially; you only know it's partially covered, don't know how much
- dotCover - no branch coverage
- ncover - no branch coverage, in maintenance mode
- ncrunch, ndepend - must see
- opencover - good branch coverage; it reached EOL , archived project
- altcover - needs investigation

Java
- JaCoCo - it just works
